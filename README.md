# Learning... rust

Why? Why not?

## About Rust

From the [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/):

> The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

## My system

  + Arch Linux (custom zen kernel)
  + Rust installed using Arch Packages

If you're in doubt on how to proceed, please check [these](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) instructions.

## Steps

  + Checkout the branches for the actual steps

So far there's a fork of Rustlings exercises with solutions [here](https://github.com/trinaldi/rustlings-solutions). So far, most of the basic exercises are done.

This repo is based on the [The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

We'll start with the `guessing game` and move forward from then on. Rustilings is a *great* way to learn using TDD and I highly recommend it.

I'm hoping the book will clear some things out and give a broader perspective on rust and its use.

## Wanna help?

Sure, fork this repo and visit my [site](trinaldi.com) on how to contact me.

A nice approach would be using Issues/PRs, though.

Thanks :)
